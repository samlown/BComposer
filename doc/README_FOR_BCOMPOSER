= BComposer

== Introduction

The bulletin composer, list management, and delivery utility.

Bcomposer was designed initially with a simple need, to be able to create
complex email bulletins, and allow anyone to add contents to them easily
and quickly. A templating system is provided using Liquid templates (and
optionally ERB) so that bulletin contents can be stored in the database
an manipulated easily.

As the system has development, more features have been added such as 
subscription forms used by the subscribers, support for groups of projects 
sharing access to the subscribers, and statistics.

== Key Features

The following components make up the current version of BComposer:

 * Projects
 * Project Groups - A project belongs to one of these.
 * User access restrictions - limit access to certain users based by project
and function; templates for example can be accessed by designers, but not by 
the content editors.
 * Bulletins are split into seccions and sections into entries - this allows 
a template to be split into parts allowing complex layouts to be edited
easily.
 * Templating
 ** Liquid template language (also ERB, but not recommended)
 ** Used for: Bulletins, subscription emails and internal pages
 ** A set of default templates are provided.
 * Statistics - support for hidden images recording access by single users.
